# Echo-State-Network
Echo State Network (ESN) are useful to solve non-linear dynamical systems. Here are, Simulations for ESN to test votage controlled oscillator and VanderPol Oscillator. <br />
ESN_VanderPol_osc.py -> Simple Python Code for VanderPol Oscillator. <br />
ESN_vco.py -> Simple Python Code for Input controlled Oscillator. <br />
ESN_VanderPol_osc_cadence_v3.py -> Python Code for VanderPol Oscillator with activation functions of derived from neuron model simulation in cadence. <br />
ESN_vco_cadence_v3.py -> Python Code for Input controlled Oscillator with activation functions of derived from neuron model simulation in cadence. <br />
